Skater’s Recommendation App

Rediscovering skating last year in the midst of a pandemic was what sparked the inspiration for this project. After being away from skating for so many years and suffering a knee injury, I needed to start all over as a beginner skater and found it hard to find a recommended setup easily.

This is the beginning of what will ultimately become a skater’s recommendation database and app which will gather information and provide suggestions for setup based on that data shown on the form and emailed to the user.

Built in this project so far includes:

A SQLite database that stores skater and skate product information built on Flask in a Docker container
A web form to gather basic information and store it in the database.

Future plans for this project:
A dropdown in the form to choose your preferred skating style
Machine learning efforts that will gather information and provide true recommendations based on searches 
A database trigger that creates a view of recommended products and events and then sends an email to the user containing that information.
